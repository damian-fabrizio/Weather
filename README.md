# Weather

## This application will take a user inputted city name and display the LIVE temperature in that city, alongside other up to date information using an API

## Function
This application displays the title of the city as given by the user, the current to-the-minute temperature in that city, the high/low for the day, the "feels like" temperature, the time of sunrise, sunset (adjusting to local timezone of given city), humidity expressed as a percentage, pressure expressed in inches of Mercury (inHg), and lastly the wind speed expressed in mph. Above the city name there is also an icon visually expressing the current weather. For example when it is sunny, the application will display a picture of a sun. 

## Goal
The aim of this project was to get familiar working with APIs. I used the openweather.com API to retrieve all information. A heavy area of focus was the user interface of the application. The color scheme and layout of information are all intentional to create a pleasing visual experience when viewing the data. 

## Fixes
There are some adjustments that have yet to be made to this application. 
Firstly, the state or country of a given city is not specified in the application. In cases of cities in different locations that share a name there is no way to distinguish what city is being displayed. Furthermore I would like to make the application responeive to different screen sizes.
